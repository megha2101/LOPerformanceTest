Green Business Certification Inc.™
Services Agreement
BY ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU ARE FULLY AWARE OF
AND AGREE TO ALL OF THE FOLLOWING TERMS, CONDITIONS, AND PROVISIONS, YOU
REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE CONSULTED WITH AN ATTORNEY ABOUT YOUR RIGHTS AND
OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER, AND YOU ARE HEREBY ENTERING INTO A LEGALLY BINDING
AGREEMENT.
This Services Agreement (this "Agreement") is entered into by You (as defined below) and the Green Business
Certification Inc. ("GBCI"), a non­profit corporation of the District of Columbia located at 2101 L Street, NW,
Suite 500, Washington, DC 20037, and constitutes a binding agreement between You, on the one hand, and
GBCI, on the other hand. As used herein, the terms "You," "Your," "Yourself," and "Owner" refer to the
individual(s) or entity(ies) that holds all legal right to possess and control the real and personal property
associated with the Project (defined below) and that is executing this Agreement, as may be implemented by a
third party such as an architect, property manager or consultant who has been granted authority to act on Your
behalf (Your "Agent"). If this Agreement is accepted by a third party as an agent acting on behalf of a project
owner, the words "you," "your," and "yourself" as used herein will refer to the project owner rather than the
agent, and this project owner will be considered a party to this Agreement as if such entity had accepted on its
own behalf. Note: The "Owner" for a LEED for Cities Project is that municipality or other governing entity
having jurisdiction over the Project's boundaries.
If Your Agent is entering into this Agreement on Your behalf, You represent and warrant that You have
completed a "Confirmation of Agent's Authority" (the form of which is available online at
http://www.usgbc.org/resources/agent­authority) and that You or Your Agent will provide this form to GBCI
upon execution of this Agreement. GBCI shall have no obligation to render any decision or provide any other
information to You with respect to any Project sought through You Agent until You have provided this form to
GBCI. Any attempt to modify the terms of the Confirmation of Agent's Authority may render the form invalid
as determined in GBCI's sole discretion.
If more than one person or entity constitutes an Owner as defined herein, such parties must irrevocably
designate You as the sole Owner with the authority to accept this Agreement and work directly with GBCI for
the purpose of administering the LEED® Certification process (the "Primary Owner"). GBCI will only
communicate with and take direction from You as the Primary Owner with regard to the performance of GBCI's
obligations under this Agreement.
1. PURPOSE.
The purpose of this Agreement is to establish the terms and conditions of the LEED Certification Program
(the "Program") for which You are seeking LEED precertification, certification and/or recertification
(each, "Certification") to which You (or Your Agent, if any) are bound.
2. TERM.
This Agreement will become effective upon your acceptance hereof (the "Effective Date") and may not be
transferred to a different Project.
3. THE PROGRAM.
The Program consists of the process whereby GBCI reviews documentation submitted by You or on Your
behalf to determine if a building, interior space or neighborhood, as described to GBCI, complies with the
requirements of the LEED Green Building Rating System ("Rating System") You have selected for theProject, and has been recognized as having met the requirements necessary to achieve Certification or a
particular level of Certification. GBCI administers the Program and confers Certification through a license
from the U.S. Green Building Council, Inc. ("USGBC").
4. THE PLATFORM.
You will submit Project Information over one of Our Online Platforms. Your use of the Online Platform is
for the sole and exclusive purpose of registering, submitting, and/or applying for Certification and further
provided that (i) the copyright notice set forth on the document and a statement that the Materials are
being displayed and/or downloaded under permission of the Copyright Holder both appear on such
displayed and/or downloaded document, (ii) use of such documents from this Site is for informational or
personal use only, and (iii) no modification of any Materials is made.
5. THE PROJECT.
5.1 As used herein, the term "Project" refers to the real and personal property (including the buildings,
space(s), structure(s), land, fixtures, etc.) comprising the single­family home(s), multi­family residential
building(s), commercial building(s), commercial interior space(s), municipality or other governing entity
having jurisdiction over the entirety of the Project boundaries, neighborhood development, or as identified
conceptually in the neighborhood development plan or Prototype for which You are seeking Certification
under this Agreement. For any project for which You hold a tenancy interest, Your assertion of ownership
is accepted so long as Your tenancy extends to the portion of the project for which You are seeking
certification. The format of Your Project and the number of buildings and interior spaces which may
encompass Your Project, and to which this Agreement will apply, may vary depending on the manner in
which You pursue Certification.
5.2 If You are participating in the Volume Program and intend to certify multiple buildings or interior
spaces under this Agreement via a Prototype, the term "Project" refers to the Prototype you hereby register
and to each of the buildings or interior spaces ("Volume Projects") that you register in the future
associated with this Prototype. The term "Prototype" refers to the conceptual building model or
certification framework demonstrating the common design and construction elements or operations and
maintenance practices, as well as quality management processes, which will be incorporated, applied and
followed in the implementation of all associated "Volume Projects." While Your Prototype may be
submitted for precertification review, it does not represent an actual building or interior space and cannot
be independently awarded LEED Certification.
5.3 If You are pursuing Certification via the campus approach and intend to certify multiple buildings or
interior spaces within a campus environment through the registration and submission of one or more
Master Sites, the term "Project" refers to each of the buildings and interior spaces ("Campus Projects")
and each of the Master Sites for which You seek Certification. The term "Master Site" refers to a
separately registered and submitted Project consisting of a partial Application designed to represent
certain common aspects of numerous buildings or interior spaces within a campus for which Certification
is sought. Please note: while Master Sites may be submitted for review, they are grouping tools rather than
complete applications for the associated building(s) or interior space(s) and are not independently awarded
Certification.
6. APPLICATION AND RATING SYSTEM.
6.1 Upon registering Your Project, You will be able to access an electronic application (the "Application"),
to be used for the sole purpose of applying for Certification from GBCI. The Application consists of a
collection of electronic data entry screens ("Forms") which are specific to the Rating System (defined
below) and the particular format of the Project for which You registered the Project. While the Forms may
from time to time contain errors in calculation or functionality that may cause a form to misrepresent
compliance or non­compliance with a certification requirements, Your Project must nonetheless
demonstrate compliance with the underlying requirements of the applicable rating system, reference guideand MPRs. Further, GBCI may request additional documentation or resubmission of data and/or
calculations as a result of any such error in a Form. You are not required to submit an Application, and
may exit the Program at any time.
6.2 Each Application is designed to elicit information necessary to determine if a Project complies with
the requirements of Rating System that You selected for Your Project to be reviewed at the time You
registered the Project, and any applicable Minimum Program Requirements ("MPRs") associated with
such rating system (collectively "Rating System Requirements"). The Rating System may be revised and
updated from time to time. For initial certification, Your Project will be held to the Rating System
Requirements that exist at the time Your Project is registered. Regardless, if You are pursuing
Certification via the Volume Program, each Volume Project registered under this Agreement will be held
to the same Rating System Requirements as Your Prototype. If You are pursuing Certification via the
campus approach, each Campus Project will be held to the Rating System Requirements that exist at the
time the Campus Project is registered
6.3 The full text of the Rating System You have selected and the associated MPRs is published and
available for review at the USGBC website: http://www.usgbc.org. You hereby represent and warrant that
You have fully reviewed and understand the Rating System and relevant MPRs.
7. CERTIFICATION GUIDE & REFERENCE GUIDE.
7.1 As used herein, the term "Certification Guide" refers to "The Guide to LEED Certification" published
by GBCI. The Certification Guide contains extensive information and instructions related to the Program
including associated policies, processes and guidelines. You agree to comply at all times with the
Certification Guide, including all updates and changes provided to You or made available by GBCI from
time to time. The Certification Guide is available for review online at the following webpage:
http://www.usgbc.org/cert­guide. You hereby represent and warrant that You have fully reviewed and
understand the Certification Guide, and You agree to check for updates often.
7.2 As used herein, the term "Reference Guide" refers to the LEED Green Building Rating System
Reference Guide associated with the Rating System selected for Your Project, including the applicable
Reference Guide Supplement, if any, which GBCI uses use to interpret and apply the requirements of the
Rating System. The Reference Guide and Reference Guide Supplements are available for purchase at the
USGBC website: http://www.usgbc.org. USGBC periodically updates the Reference Guide and Reference
Guide Supplements by publishing Addenda online on the USGBC website. You understand that GBCI
refers to the Reference Guide and applicable Reference Guide Supplement, if any, including all changes
and Addenda published by USGBC for interpretation.
8. CERTIFICATION REVIEW.
8.1 Upon receipt of Your Application, GBCI will initiate its review to determine if Your Project is eligible
for Certification. During a review, GBCI may request additional documentation, resubmission of
calculations and any other information GBCI deems relevant. GBCI will strive to meet the review
timelines set forth in the Certification Guide (each, a "Review Timeline"); however, the Review Timelines
are estimates only. GBCI's failure to meet any Review Timeline will not be considered a breach of this
Agreement and You will not be entitled to any remedy, including a refund of any portion of any Fees paid
by You under this Agreement. Further, GBCI's failure to meet any Expedited Review Timeline provided in
the Certification Guide will not be considered a breach of this Agreement and You will not be entitled to
any remedy under this Agreement; however, GBCI will refund any premium fees paid by You to expedite
the review.
8.2 You recognize and acknowledge that GBCI is a nonprofit organization engaged in the effort to lessen
the environmental impacts of buildings and communities, and that the Program, while regulated by
specific policies and standards, also requires discretion and judgment. The decision whether to grant or
deny Certification to a Project will be made in the sole discretion of GBCI based on GBCI's interpretationof the Rating System, the sufficiency of the submitted Project Information (defined below), and any other
information or factors that GBCI deems relevant.
9. THE ONLINE PLATFORM.
The online platform will be available to You twenty­four hours a day, seven days a week, other than when
unavailable for maintenance, however GBCI does not guarantee the availability of an online platform or
that access to it will be uninterrupted or error free. GBCI reserves the right to interrupt, limit, or suspend
the platform from time to time for purposes of maintenance, upgrades, modifications, or similar reasons.
You understand and agree that GBCI may upgrade or otherwise modify the online platform at any time in
its sole discretion and that GBCI shall not be held responsible or liable for any damages arising from any
interruption, suspension, or termination of the certification platform, regardless of the cause.
10. PROGRAM UPGRADES/RATING SYSTEM UPGRADES.
From time to time GBCI may develop and make available new versions of the online platform designed to
enhance the Application and improve the certification process. You may be allowed to upgrade to a new
version of the online platform as limited in the Certification Guide. If You are entering into this
Agreement with the intention of upgrading (meaning, registering a Project that has been previously
registered under another version), You understand and agree that this Agreement will supersede,
extinguish and take the place of any and all agreements You previously entered into with GBCI regarding
such Project. You agree that the additional benefits to You and to GBCI provided under this Agreement
constitute good and valuable consideration and that this Agreement comprises a valid novation with
regard to any prior agreements entered into regarding any Project registered under this Agreement.
11. OPTIONAL SERVICES.
GBCI and/or USGBC may make available certain optional services to assist You to complete the
Application, apply the Rating System requirements to Your Project, confirm Your status as a participant in
the Program, and/or confirm the status or progress of Your Project, including without limitation, the

Optional Services by GBCI, GBCI's subcontractors and/or USGBC shall be governed by the terms of this
Agreement, including without limitation, all provisions herein related to indemnification and limitations
of liability.
12. FEES.
12.1 In consideration for GBCI's review of Your Project Information (defined below) and the provision of
any Optional Services that You request under this Agreement, You agree to pay GBCI certain fees in
accordance with the "Fee Schedule". The Fee Schedule is available for review online at the following
webpage: http://www.usgbc.org/cert­guide/fees. The Fees that You will incur will vary depending on the
manner in which You pursue Certification and the amount of Optional Services You request. GBCI will
invoice You for all applicable Fees as they are incurred. All Fees must be paid within sixty (60) calendar
days of the date of GBCI's invoice and are non­transferable. If GBCI does not receive payment within 60
days of invoicing You, and the Fee Schedule has increased the Fees during such time, You will be required
to submit the increased Fee. You hereby represent and warrant that You have fully reviewed and
understand the Fee Schedule, and You agree to check for updates often. GBCI shall not refund any fees in
the event You fail to submit documentation for review and/or terminate the registration for Your Project.
12.2 GBCI reserves the right to increase the Fees by no more than twenty seven percent (27%) per
calendar year. You agree to pay the then­current fees as they are incurred. GBCI will provide You with noless than ninety (90) days prior written notice of any Fee increases. You may elect to pay any Fees in
advance. If You pay any Fees in advance, You will not be charged for the difference should a subsequent
increase occur; should Your Project increase in size, You will be charged any additional fees at the
increased rate. Should Your Project decrease in size, You will be refunded any fees at the rate at which
You pre­paid. Should You not agree to any of GBCI's Fee increases, Your sole remedy is to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 14. In the event You elect to terminate this Agreement, You will forego
any benefit for which You have paid in advance, and GBCI will not be required to provide You with any
refund.
13. PROJECT INFORMATION.
13.1 License to Use for Purpose of Assessment. In order to complete the Certification application process,
You must submit extensive information to GBCI related to the Project, including without limitation, any
information related to You or Your Project provided prior to executing this Agreement, information
contained within the Application(s) and any additional information or data provided to GBCI in
connection with the Project (collectively, "Project Information"). You hereby grant GBCI and the GBCI
Affiliates and subcontractors a perpetual, non­exclusive, royalty­free, fully paid­up and irrevocable license
to access, view, reproduce and otherwise use all Project Information submitted to GBCI, including all
copyrighted materials, tradenames and other proprietary information, for the purposes of assessing the
Project.
13.2 "Public" Projects. LEED­registered and certified projects are, by default, considered "public" projects
and, as such, they are included in a public directory of projects (the "LEED Project Directory"). Inclusion
in the LEED Project Directory allows the general public and members of the media to look up specific
project listings and the following details: project name, project address, project typology, registration date,
identity of the owner, owner organization type, project team information, project gross square footage,
and, to the extent that the Project achieves certification, date of certification, identification of which
credits were sought and which and how many were achieved, the level of certification achieved, and the
currency of performance data reporting(collectively, "Public Project Information"). GBCI shall not
distribute or publish any submitted plans, drawings or schematics pertaining to any project without
permission except to GBCI's employees, agents, representatives, contractors, and subsidiaries for the
purpose of assessing the Project.
13.3 "Private" Projects. A project may opt­out of the LEED Project Directory and publicity opportunities
by electing to be a "private project" at the time of registration. By electing to remain "private", the
project's name, street address and identity of the owner and associated project team information will not
appear within the LEED Project Directory. However, certain other non­project identifying information
may be disclosed, including, but not limited to, the city and state in which the project is located and the
total project square footage and, to the extent the Project achieves certification, the date of certification,
identification of which credits were sought and which and how many were achieved, the level of
certification achieved, and the currency of performance data reporting (the "Directory Private Project
Information"). All private projects that achieve Certification will be prompted upon issuance of award, if
any, to transition to public status. A project that wishes to remain a private project must re­confirm its
private status at the time of certification. Nota bene: For so long as You maintain a project as a "private
project", You agree not to market or represent the project to the general public as having applied for
Certification or as being Certified, and no intellectual property including the Marks may be utilized or
displayed in relation to the project. You may change the privacy setting for a project from private to public
at any time before acceptance of the final award, using functionality in the online platform.
13.4 License to Aggregated, Non­Identifying Information. Whether or not You elect for Your Project to be
private, you hereby confer the right to GBCI's and the GBCI Affiliates to publish, display, reproduce,
distribute, perform and/or create derivative works from the Project Information only in aggregated, nonidentifying form (the "Aggregated Project Information").13.5 License for Internal Use. You agree that GBCI and the GBCI Affiliates may make internal use of any
Project Information submitted to GBCI – whether by a public or private project –including, and not
limited to, project performance data.
13.6 License for Public Use. You further agree that GBCI and the GBCI Affiliates may also access,
publish, reproduce, display, distribute, perform, and/or create derivative works from Your Public Project
Information (from a public project) and Directory Private Project Information (from a private projects)
and Aggregated Project Information, to, inter alia, educate and provide resources for LEED project teams
and others, showcase project strategies and promote the LEED Building Standard on a global scale.
13.7 No Public Endorsement. Each party to this agreement agrees that it shall not furnish any company
logo, trademark (except tradename to identify the Project) or proprietary indicia of the other or any
affiliate in any press release, testimonial, quotations, case study, or endorsement without the other party's
prior written consent, whose approval shall not unreasonably be withheld.
13.8 Disclosure When Legally Compelled. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent GBCI from disclosing
information when legally compelled to do so by duty, order or command under color of law. Unless
prohibited by law, prompt notice of any compelled disclosure will be provided to You to facilitate an
opportunity to limit or prevent such disclosure at Your sole expense. Without limitation, GBCI may
disclose Project Information if such disclosure is deemed to be in the interest of immediate public safety.
13.9 Classified Information. GBCI does not wish to receive classified information. Any information or
materials submitted to GBCI will be deemed to be not classified. By submitting information to GBCI, You
represent that such information, be it submitted in connection with an Application for Certification or
otherwise, is not controlled for export under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, 22 C.F.R. Part
120 et seq., or the Export Administration Regulations, 15 C.F.R. Part 730 et seq.
14. TRADEMARKS.
14.1 USGBC owns all rights to several proprietary trademarks, service marks, certification marks, logos
and other graphic images, including, but not limited to, the "LEED" trademark and the LEED
Certification trademarks (collectively, the "Marks") and, pursuant to licenses from USGBC, in the event
You receive Certification, GBCI has the right to grant You the limited right to use the Marks as set forth
herein. The Marks constitute valuable intellectual property held by USGBC and GBCI and their licensors
and are protected by law. You acknowledge and agree that any unauthorized use of these Marks
constitutes both intellectual property infringement and a breach of this Agreement.
14.2 While Your Project is under review, GBCI and USGBC grant You the limited right to use the
applicable Marks (depending on the format of the Program You choose to participate in) to indicate that
You are applying for Certification, and/or have achieved precertification, under the Program; provided
however, that You are prohibited from using the Marks in any manner that indicates or implies (as
determined by GBCI in its sole and absolute discretion) that the Project has achieved, or will achieve,
Certification at any level. In the event that Your Project, or any portion thereof, is awarded Certification
by GBCI, then, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, GBCI and USGBC grant You a
non­exclusive, non­sublicenseable, non­transferable, revocable (in the sole discretion of GBCI), royaltyfree, limited license to use the applicable Marks, depending on the Program in which You choose to
participate and the level of Certification achieved, for the purposes of indicating the level of Certification
granted in relation to the Project.
14.3 Despite anything that may be to the contrary in this Agreement, in connection with all use of the
Marks as set forth herein, You agree to use the Marks in accordance with all applicable laws, rules and
regulations, and You will comply at all times with the USGBC Trademarks Policy as published by
USGBC and as may be updated from time to time (the "Trademark Usage Policy"), and any other
reasonable related standards associated with the use of the Marks as provided by GBCI in writing to You.
The Trademark Usage Policy is available at the USGBC website: http://www.usgbc.org/trademarks. Youhereby represent and warrant that You have fully reviewed the Trademark Usage Policy, and You agree to
check for updates often.
14.4 All rights not expressly granted herein are reserved by GBCI and USGBC, and no license is granted
hereunder for the use of the Marks for any purpose beyond the uses set forth in this Section 11, or to any
other intellectual property of GBCI or USGBC. You acknowledge and affirm USGBC's ownership of the
Marks and the validity and enforceability thereof, and You shall not engage in or support any action, claim
or challenge that is inconsistent with the foregoing. All use of the Marks and the goodwill associated
therewith shall inure to the sole benefit of USGBC.
14.5 You acknowledge that the Marks and the goodwill associated therewith possess special, unique, and
extraordinary characteristics, which make difficult the assessment of monetary damages that GBCI and
USGBC would sustain as a result of Your unauthorized use of the Marks. You recognize that GBCI and
USGBC would suffer irreparable injury by such unauthorized use and agree that injunctive and other
equitable relief is appropriate in the event of a breach by You of any of the terms of this Section 11. Such
remedy shall not be exclusive of any other remedies available to GBCI and USGBC, nor shall it be
deemed an election of remedies by GBCI or USGBC.
15. TERM AND TERMINATION.
15.1 The term of this Agreement begins when You accept this Agreement in accordance with Section 32
below, and shall continue in effect unless terminated as follows:
a. You may terminate this Agreement in whole or in part at any time upon thirty (30) days written

and judgment may be entered thereupon and enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. All
costs and expenses of any Arbitration, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses and the
administrative and arbitrator fees and expenses, shall be borne by the parties as determined by the
arbitrators. Nothing in this Section 22 shall be construed as limiting the right of a party to seek, in a
court of competent jurisdiction, an injunction or other equitable relief in aid of arbitration (including
to maintain the status quo or preserve the subject matter of the arbitration) with respect to any actual
or threatened breach of this Agreement or otherwise, to prevent or avoid irreparable harm. Nothing
herein shall permit the arbitrators to award any damages which are disclaimed in this Agreement,
including those in Section 18.

conditions of this Agreement shall remain in effect and the parties shall continue to perform all of
their respective obligations hereunder.5. Except to the limited extent necessary to comply with any applicable law, legal process, or a court
order or to enforce a final settlement agreement or secure enforcement of the arbitrators' award, the

disclosed in any Arbitration or evidencing any arbitration results, award, judgment or settlement, or
the performance thereof, and any allegations, statements and admissions made or positions taken by
either party in any Arbitration shall be treated and maintained in confidence and are not intended to
be used or disclosed for any other purpose or in any other forum.
